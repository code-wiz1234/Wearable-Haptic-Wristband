# Wearable-Haptic-Wristband

*Overview
This is an ongoing project to design a wearable haptic wristband capable of delivering localized vibration feedback using multiple Linear Resonant Actuators (LRAs). The wristband aims to enhance user experience by guiding their hand in a virtual space.

#Goals
Deliver precise, localized haptic feedback around the wrist
Independently control multiple LRAs
Maintain a compact, wearable design

#System Architecture
Microcontroller: Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32-C3 for low-power wearable control
Haptic Actuators: Multiple LRAs positioned around the wrist
LRA Drivers:  DRV2605L Haptic Controller Breakout- Individual drivers for precise vibrations 

#Current Status
Hardware components identified and planned
MCU, LRA drivers, and MUX selection completed
PCB and wearable layout in progress
Software and control logic yet to be implemented
